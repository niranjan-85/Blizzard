# Blizzard :- Node-Express Weather Application

This application makes use of the Geolocation API (client-side) and returns 
the latitude and the longitude of the user by using their IP address.

The latitude and longitude are then passed as parameters to another API (weatherapi.com) which then 
gives the current weather of that particular location and also gives the predicted weather for 
the next 2 days.

The application uses :

1. [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
2. [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
3. [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)
